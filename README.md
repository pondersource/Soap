# Soap server-client in php :bulb:

##  What Soap does :question:

SOAP (formerly an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks

## Soap Client :mag:

A SOAP client sends the XML document to a SOAP server. This SOAP request is posted using HTTP or HTTPS to a SOAP Request Handler running as a servlet on a Web server. ... A response from the service is returned to the SOAP Request Handler Servlet and then to the caller using the standard SOAP XML payload format.

## Soap Server :mag:

The Web Services Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) server is an application server plug-in that receives and sends XML data, and provides XML SOAP interfaces into the Tivoli Management Services components and the monitoring agents.

## Why do we need WSDL with SOAP :question:

- an envelope, which defines the message structure and how to process it

- a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes

- a convention for representing procedure calls and responses
